42743,1,"One thing in particular that would make me angry would be if he got the opportunity to continue ""leading"" the country during a pandemic. That man has absolutely no idea how to handle a crisis and should not have been trusted to ""lead this country in the first place. All of his decisions, or lack thereof, regarding this pandemic have allowed things to escalate so that this country is among the highest in terms of cases and mortality rates and I would not be able to handle another four years with him being allowed to make decisions.",,,,

44528,1,"What makes me most afraid is his lack of concern for the entire population of the United States and how unprofessional he is. I'm scared that the state of the country will just get worse with no plausible plan to stop the spread of Covid-19, and no care for minorities in the country, just allowing more rifts to shape and more people to be unrightfully killed by police and not get justice. I'm scared that he will harm us in the worsening of climate change since he doesn't even believe it's real, and allow the country and state of the world to worsen. I'm scared for my future and if it is even ethical to have kids. ",,,,
44285,1,"I would be super concerned that he'd continue to dismantle the hardwork of the Obama administration. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg passing away, he has more potential to do even more harm in terms of the judicial system. People like me would likely continue to be targeted and there wouldn't be a lot of peace. Also if he continues for four more years, I imagine that there is definitely going to be more progress on that stupid wall.

42891,1,"One thing that I think is really scary is that most presidents become more extreme in their second term because they no longer need to worry about public opinion for re-election. President Trump is a wild card. In his first term, he was erratic and inconsiderate of the public. His supreme court pick is a woman who disagrees with a woman's bodily autonomy. Trump has numerous allegations of sexual misconduct including one from a 13-year-old girl. I would never want to be in a room alone with him. He treats the pandemic like it's a hoax. He has made it abundantly clear that when things don't go his way, he will find any and every excuse to explain his loss. ",,,,
41785,1,"I think that since I am a minority female he has said things that are just very disrespectful to not only people of color, but people of different sexualities, and religions. I am a straight woman but again I am accepting of everyone. I don't find myself to be a religious person but again I find myself accepting of everyone. This might just be the way I was raised by the beliefs that he has do not align with what I believe in. I also think that he is not trying to progress us to move forward I think he would like it if women didn't have a say in anything which is why he is trying to shut down planned parenthood which is taking away many options for women not just with abortion but with many other accommodations that we have the right to. I think that his values are very localized on himself and moving himself forward but he does not seem to care about who he has to take down in order to get and stay at the top of his own game. ",,,,

44379,1,"Speaking as a woman, I am terrified of women's rights being taken away. Trump has said that he is against abortion and it seems that if he in elected again, they will take away women's contraceptive and abortion rights. This is awful and it scares me. Birth control is not just for sex and he does NOT understand that. Abortion makes sense in many situations and it is not up to anyone else to make this decision for women. It should only be their choice. For example, if a 12 year old girl got raped and got pregnant, she has a right to get an abortion. If this right is taken away, this poor girl will have to have this baby and that is so beyond messed up. Even writing this, it scares me. Also, I am afraid of Trump saying something dumb and offensive and risking our relationships with other countries in the world. Ever since he got elected, I think other countries see the United States as a joke and this is terrifying. Also, he has a short temper and this has been proven, so I am scared of him bombing countries that we have no business getting involved with. He does not think of his country first, he puts himself first and this is not what a president should do. ",,,,
43719,2,"What would make me most angry... It's sort of complex, and only really applies to me personally so I don't know if this would get anybody else riled up, but I'll do my best to explain. Ever since I was younger, I had certain intense sort of spiritual experiences that came, sometimes from reading books, (like Siddhartha, Catcher in the Rye, novels of Charles Bukowski,) sometimes while having conversations with my father, sometimes after being in a humiliating social situations, sometimes while doing nothing at all. These experiences all made me feel much closer to the world and the state of existence in general, but farther from other people. It seemed to me that everybody I knew acted in some sort of phony way and didn't really understand anything. I notice that much less now and have a much more optimistic view about people, but I still feel that I am hyper-attuned to people who don't properly think about the state of being, who are dishonest with themselves about what the truth really is. And to me, as someone who lives in a deeply liberal community, it seems like the liberal side of the political spectrum has run completely off the rails with regard to being honest with themselves and others about the true state of things. So, if Joe Biden wins, I feel it will be a victory for those people, and that makes me somewhat angry. Sorry that I couldn't go very in depth, it would probably take many more pages.",,,,
45501,1,"I am afraid that everything that is wrong with America will keep getting worse. Discrimination, the spread of COVID-19, and the impact of climate change are what makes me most concerned. Trump has made it clear that he will not denounce white supremacy and I fear that hate crimes and discrimination in general will increase if he wins. I am afraid that the pandemic will get worse in America and Trump will be hesitant to put the county back into lock down even if that is what is needed to stop the spread. I am afraid that the way he has spoken about scientists will make the public not trust them, so that when a vaccine finally comes out not enough people will get it. I am afraid that my loved ones will die of COVID-19 because of the way he is treating the pandemic. I am also afraid that his reluctance to act aggressively to combat climate change will make it worse and our environment and planet will suffer.  ",,,,
45432,1,"If he won, I would be most angry with how he evokes the worst out of so many people. People look up to his racist ways, which do not fly with me. Knowing that there is a chance he can win angers me, because to vote for Trump, you are racist. He promotes racism, and by voting for him, you are promoting racism. He is anti-immigrant, and immigrants are what make our country amazing and unique. Immigrants are hard-working and determined and motivated, and they do not take away from anyone's jobs or homes.",,,,
44483,1,"If Donald Trump wins the election, I would be most upset about how he might act with regard to LGBTQ+ rights. As a person in this community, I am now worried that our rights to a lawful marriage might be taken away from us. For the majority of my life, I have been able to imagine what I want my future to look like. Donald Trump has taken so much from us as Americans already, and it would make me the angriest if he were to allow this right to be taken from us. On the topic of how angry I would be if he revoked LGBTQ+ rights, I would also be EXTREMELY upset if he were to take away/support the idea of taking away our opportunity to adopt children. Children are also a big part of my imagined future. As minorities, we have been through so much as a community throughout history. People need to stop taking things from us.",,,,
44610,1,"I am afraid that if Trump is reelected basic human rights will be in danger. people part of the lgbtq community, especially transgender folks have suffered during his current presendancy.I also believe that the environment is at risk because he doesn't ""believe"" in climate change ",,,,
45308,1,"If Donald Trump wins the election, women, POCs, immigrants, and members of the LGBT+ community stand to lose their rights. Trump favors heterosexual white men, to the point of believing in their white supremacy (see: Proud Boys). If he wins, Planned Parenthood loses millions of dollars in funding, funding that would be used to provide safe reproductive healthcare, NOT JUST ABORTIONS. If he wins, women will most likely lose much autonomy over their bodies. If he wins, immigrants will be subject to even more of his cruel and racist abuse and possibly deported/hunted down by the government simply because Trump doesn't like the color of their skin, or their religion, or where they came from. If he wins, the LGBT+ community stands to lose the right to marriage. If he wins, the separation of church and state will never happen, and radical religion will continue to influence the decisions the government makes, decisions that will only benefit the people Trump wants them to benefit. If Donald Trump wins the election, we will witness the downfall of America.",,,,
41812,1,"If he wins the election I fear that we will not make any more strides towards environmental protection and dealing with climate change. I am concerned and scared since many prominent researchers say we only have about 7 years to reverse the damages of climate change and Donald Trump does not believe in it. Once time is up the World may start burning or we may have limited time on Earth before it dies out which will affect future generations to come. With COVID he has also shown how he just does not listen to the scientists or seem to put the American people first, and I believe he is very much a dictator and not good for our country. Donald Trump does not care about the American people and is just on a power trip. ",,,,

44086,1,"If Donald Trump were to win the 2020 Presidential Election, I personally would be upset about more general things. Since I'm not too well versed with political matters, many times I choose to not take a side or strictly identify as conservative or liberal. However, many of Donald Trump's actions that I've seen from his current presidential term greatly upset me. For example, his all too liberal and frequent use of social media—I can appreciate the attempt to be more than a faraway figure, but too much of what he says on Twitter sounds like uneducated, not thoroughly considered thoughts. Much of my early impression of him was that he was like a child, who said whatever he wanted to and whenever he wanted to, and I dread this continuing if he is re-elected. I also am greatly upset by his response to COVID-19, typically with so much scientific proof, so many scientists by his side, and so many people to consult and discuss with, I would've expected a better response to the pandemic. Instead, much of what Trump says is downplaying the virus. Regardless of the statistics, so-called facts, and his own beliefs that he broadcasts, I would hope that the president of the United States of America is not so flippant about the deaths of American people. While I understand that Donald Trump's background is as a businessman, and his ""tactics"" are very different from a politicians, too much of the time do I get the impression of an uneducated, inconsiderate man, when looking at the president. I believe that a president should strive to unify and strengthen the country, not say divisive and polarizing things, and act nonchalant towards a pandemic. What I see from Donald Trump currently, would all still upset me if he were re-elected.",,,,

If Donald Trump wins it will validate all of these feelings of superiority in groups who hold the most power.",,,,

44620,1,"It's hard to think of one thing that makes me most angry, but the first one that comes to mind is the white supremacist rhetoric that he seems to evoke in people. Trump's election was a direct response to Obama's presidency. Insecure, small-minded white people were afraid that their country was being led by a black man. They felt their world slipping away, so they voted for Trump because he explicitly ran on white supremacist values. I fear that the problems of police brutality and institutionalized racism in this country will continue to go unsolved, and probably get even worse. The biggest threat to the USA right now is right wing terrorist groups from our own country who do not want people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people to have rights and who are inspired by Trump's racism. If he wins again, I fear for all people in these categories, especially those who belong to multiple minorities (like trans women of color who are murdered at preposterous rates, another issue that will go unsolved with another Trump term).",,,,
45207,1,"The thing I am most afraid of if Donald Trump wins is the continued mockery of America and the ideals that were once important and represented in society. Hate and intolerance has become so normalized in the United States and I think a large part of it is because of Trump. He does little, if anything, to condemn white supremacists and does nothing to bring different communities together. Because of this separation, people are more likely to say negative things in public to absolute strangers. And most importantly this divide in views has impacted politics to the point where people are less focused on what candidates actually stand for, and more interested in the political party that they are affiliated with. The public will now vote for candidates simply if they have ""Democrat"" or ""Republican"" next to their name without knowing anything about their platform or their views. This is dangerous and needs to be changed. ",,,,

The rights of a woman's body belong to that woman and that woman only, and I do not believe that anyone else should be able to make decisions around that. If Donald Trumps choice of senate is elected into office, then it is possible that enough chairs in the senate could agree to uplift the laws that came from Roe v Wade, which could outlaw abortion again at the federal level, making many states able to make it illegal again. This is something that is a thing of the past, along with a lot of Trumps beliefs, and they are not the mindset that we should be in. ",,,,

This man is probably the only president in our history without any background with politics or government. As a businessman, his methods work. Unfortunately, our country is not his company and he should treat it more like a nation than one of his towers that he can suck money out of. He doesn't think things through and that is hurting our country more than we realize. I live in a good family where we have everything and are able to buy the things we need. However, our economy is dropping and he's not doing anything to help it. He is a hypocrite and does not keep to his words. His argument of Make America Great Again is a joke in this current campaign because we are in this terrible state due to his policies.",,,,
44581,1,"If Donald Trump were the win the 2020 presidential election, it'd leave me not only angry but as well as unhopeful about the future of the country. Ever since he took office, the country has gone to shit -- specifically with his response to the COVID-19 pandemic. When you take a look at the countries in Asia, they are doing dramatically better compared to the beginning of the pandemic. Some have even reached a point where masks are not longer mandatory and the daily cases have remained at zero. America could have been at same phase as them, however, the president chose to downplay the severity of the virus. He has fooled so many people into thinking the whole pandemic is a hoax when there are literal facts to prove how real and terrible it is. Trump have pushed so many Americans into the mindset to not to care for the people around them, people are so selfish now a days. We are regressing as a country.",,,,

In summary, I'm afraid of seeing so much of the progress we have made as a society in terms of social acceptance being thrown away.

It would make me angry that Americans are willing to endorse a person with so much hate in them and who takes no accountability for any of their actions.

I guess the thing that would make me the most angry would be having to listen to him talk, and listening to the way some people support him no matter what he says. Donald Trump has said some of the most racist, sexist, and straight up disgusting things I have heard in my entire life from any person, especially a man in power of our country. From the way he has talked about how he can grab any women and have relations with them just because he is a man in power (whether they consent or not) to the way he discredits other women by calling them unintelligent or crazy, it is so frustrating to hear as a young woman in this country. The only thing more frustrating than hearing our President say these things about women, is hearing the people in my life, whether it be family, friends, or strangers, AGREE with his moral standings. It's not just about women though, for Donald Trump has also said horrible things about immigrants from Mexico, and black people, especially recently during the protests for Black Lives Matter. If that isn't bad enough, Trump has mocked people with disabilities and mental illnesses such as addiction in front of live crowds. I think the President and I do not agree on one thing in terms of our moral standings.

In addition, if Trump were to win, there would be no change in the laws regarding the police system, which systematically oppresses minorities and people of color, many families at the border who are seeking a better life will continue to be separated and abused, and there continue to be relatively easy access to automatic weapons, which leads to even more gun violence across the nation.

As a woman, it terrifies me to have a misogynist in office because he is reinforcing the behavior and telling other like-minded individuals that is okay to behave the way he does, while he demonstrates little to no respect for women. As a member of a minority religion who is often the target for hate crimes his response in the first presidential debate was terrifying, ""Proud Boys, stand by, and stand back.""

My safety at school is always a thought of mine as republicans in office try to demonize democratic representatives who want to reform gun control laws, as school shootings are still on the rise in America. The only reason why we haven't had such high numbers of school shootings this year is because there were no open schools due to the President's idiotic way of handling the Covid-19 virus.

He wants to send back all the immigrants who have been living in America for so long and has already made plans to seperate immigrant children born in the US from their parents, which is so so cruel.

I think the racial injustice and discrimination throughout the country are incredibly terrible but personally, I think covid is a more pressing matter at this time because thousands of people are dying and Trump is only making it worse. 
I think right now the world is falling apart and the US is doing the worst job at controlling the virus, I think if Trump is elected there is little to no hope that America will be out of this within the next 4 years. Trump will continuously lie to the American people and unfortunately, there are many American people that will believe everything he says. If he were to follow the science and suggested actions to be taken then we wouldn't be in the mess we are and hundreds of thousands of Americans would be alive and well. I think America is doomed if Trump is elected and I couldn't feel anymore passionate about this topic. 
It is incredibly hard to pick one detail that would make me most angry but if I had to pick it would have to be the health and safety of every American currently. ",,,,

Climate change will be irreversible and will have detrimental damage on the world. If we want the future generations to have a place to live, Donald Trump can absolutely not win the election this year.

I was horrified after hearing about the way he conducted himself in the first presidential debate against Biden. He disrespected Biden and constantly talked over him and the monitor asking the questions. He avoids the questions, lies, and didn't answer them which doesn't make him very trust worthy at all. I was disgusted by the way he attacked bidders family and disrespected his sons for no reason. That had nothing to do with politics that was just a personal jab in attempt to make him look bad. Biden's sons aren't running for president that should have nothing to do with the election. Trump is disrespectful of minorities, pro people, women, and people of color. He is an unlikeable person and I am scared of him personally I would not want to meet him. I haven't seen him do a single good/positive thing since he became president.

He is also supremely unintelligent and listening to him try to string a sentence together is painful. I do not understand how anyone has any respect for him, especially after four years if incompetency and unfulfilled promises. He is personally responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans due to Covid-19, because of his failure of a response to the pandemic.

He is not taking COVID seriously as he should, he tries to play it off as if he can handle it, however, the United States is slowing taken over by COVID.

Additionally, Donald Trump has shown to not support the Black Lives Matter movement, and tries to create fear about the peaceful protests against police brutality in this country.

Trump has fervently argued that he is not racist, but we know that he is and I fear for my parents and younger sibling.

I was very angry when I saw how many people justified the behavior of Kyle Rittenhouse the 17 yer old Kenosha shooter. He had traveled across state lines with the intention of causing harm to protestors who where assembled to protest against police brutality. He killed two people and injured another. In my eyes, that was an act of domestic terrorism. Of course, this country does not recognize white men as terrorists so when I saw the reactions of many Trump supporters, I was disgusted.

When he won back in 2016, although he didn't conduct any violence himself, he certainly didn't argue against racially charged violence from his supporters. A lot of swastikas and slurs were everywhere and I really do not want to see that happen again. I'm afraid that white supremacists and Nazis will have more confidence to reak havoc in another Trump era. In addition, I'm afraid that more rights and freedoms will be stripped away from marginalized groups. For example, DACA was threatened to be taken away. Now that ACB is confirmed, partially because of Trump's nomination, I am scared that more freedoms will be taken away. As a person from a marginalized group myself, it is scary walking around in America where I could be potentially beat up or ridiculed just because of how my identity is viewed. ",,,,

Things in the country have become worse in the last four years, and they were not good to begin with in 2016. He has uncovered the racism that lay dormant and unshared for years, and he's ignited a force of racism and discrimination that so many people identify with across the country. Black bodies are dying in the streets, and this is a scary way to live for Black Americans. It shows that not very much progress has been made over the last 400 years and that things can only get worse with someone who identifies with racism directly is in our highest office. People need to use their privilege to protect these lives, even if they're not Black. It is on white people to push forward equality that Black Americans have been fighting for for centuries in this country, and with Donald Trump in office for another four years, this push for equality and equity will get nowhere.

I am scared for a potential war or uprising or revolution that will cause a lot of harm, even if it creates something good in the end. I am afraid of being a part of a history chapter, especially one with a lot of violence, death and suffering.

He has not done anything beneficial for our country as he promised he would and has only done damage if anything. While I would not consider Joe Biden to be the best fit, he is most certainly the better choice and has an actual plan of attack for helping our country and it's people.

I also don't want everyone to have free healthcare because I like having a choice in doctors. I do not think that an illegal immigrant should receive medical care before an American citizen. Also, with the career I plan to go into, I could make a lot of money, and I don't think it's fair that Joe Biden wants to raise taxes and take that away.

The Black Lives Matter movement has been one of the biggest movements in history and there are not enough policies that have changed. Many people are misinformed and ignorant about the movement and do not know how people of color are treated in the community.

As someone who uses birth control to regulate the side effects of my period, without it I would be in frequent excruciating pain and it is simply unfair and unjust for people in higher power who can easily afford these benefits to take them away from people who cannot afford them.

Trump has made repeated homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic, sexist, ect. comments whilst his presidency. And half the stuff he says isn't even within his own private life. He says these things publicly. At this rate a vote for Trump is the equivalent of voicing your own hatred for minority populations, or at least that you think what he does is ok. The republican party can surely find someone who isn't as openly mean, one with the same political views about economy, military, ect. At least if we have an equally as republican president, they wont promote those behaviors on a national platform. At the core of my point is I don't think you need to be a racist, homophobe, ect. in order to be a republican. I think republicans can do better than promoting that bigotry. If not then I think our country is considerably more inconsiderate than I would like to think and certainly not some were I would like to live.",,,,

I am terrified of how other countries will think of us if Trump wins again, and how tensions between nations will rise. It makes me nervous about wars. We had threats of North Korea bombing us over things Trump said not long ago.

I'm hoping Biden wins so he can arrange stricter regulations of social-distancing so the COVID cases in the US can finally die down. However, if Trump were to win, he would not enforce stricter guidelines to reduce cases and Americans will still have to still stay at home as the virus gets worse. It's such a shame that Trump won't do anything to try to reduce cases and make us stay at home while other countries around the world are steadily returning back to their normal lives. it's crucial that in America we reduce cases so Americans can return to their normal lives.

NOW four years later I think he has made a lot of questionable choices and has not owned up to them which I believe is a flaw in a leader. I am afraid that if he wins life will still be the way it is now which is not ideal. He has not handle this pandemic well at all, he is holding rallies as I type this, encouraging people not let Covid take over, barely wears a mask and has overall just downplayed this virus.

It makes me afraid for all of the children women and people of color in our country as well as those who not cis or straight. The way we have seemingly lost thousands of children and those in our government seem to be corrupt and in participation of sex trafficking rings makes me terrified and the way that our law enforcement has been shown to conduct themselves and the lack of funding for other social service departments scares me because it can only get worse with Trump in office.

He did not tell Americans about the first cases in the US until much later, precious time people could have used to prepare for the pandemic and what was to come. It also would have saved lives. He is almost never seen wearing a mask and it does not seem like he supports masks, which protect others. This is a selfish move and as the president, he is setting an example for the entire country that many people do in fact follow. This causes more people to get sick and in turn more deaths. On top of this, he also has been found to say that he does not believe in climate change and given the impending disaster we are soon to be facing, this is very concerning. There need to be steps taken right now so that we can change the predictions of the detriment of our earth (and us along with it) for the better. He also does not have a concrete plan for health care for those he plans to take Obamacare away from - in the middle of a pandemic. In addition to this, I am not so sure we can trust a president that seems to have business relations in enemy countries and more than a diplomatic relationship (friendly, even) with our enemies. Not to mention, the scandals that have arisen from other countries meddling in our nation’s elections. On top of this, Trump has yet to release his taxes after 4 years of saying he will, begging the question: what does he have to hide? Having a president that speaks like him and tweets like him has been an embarrassment to this country like no other president, however scandalous, has been. To think that a businessman and tv show host had become our president with absolutely no experience in politics still baffles me. It would be a true mystery and shame if he was re-elected.",,,,

Donald Trump was raised on the wealth of others and racist ideas about others.

Money is his main goal and priority; not me, you or any of the American people! VOTE!",,,,
42411,1,"I feel that Donald Trump has done nothing that is substantially good for the country.  He made promises back in 2016 and he has not come through with them.  His recent justice is underqualified and was rushed through when she is a threat to the affordable care act, during a pandemic, as well as planned parenthood in the United States, meaning thousands of people will die because they cannot afford normal care they also now can't go to planned parenthood for screenings, birth control, etc.  Donald Trump has also threatened the rights of LGBTQ+ people taking away the rights of trans people to go into the military, as well as allowing doctors to turn them away when they need serious medical care.  He has tried to pass bills that would not allow same-sex couples to adopt, and the recent justice will most likely overturn the ruling that allowed same-sex couples to marry in all 50 states.  His response to covid 19 was laughable, calling it a hoax, and the same as the flu.  He caused the deaths of 200,000+ Americans where other countries have had substantially fewer deaths because they believed in science, he tried to withhold help with covid from senators that not support him, and he tried to politicize the vaccine, trying to push it through before it was prepared and possibly risking the lives as it is not fully tested so we do not know the side effects of people just to get a slight boost in polls.  He also does not believe climate change is real, he has removed certain restrictions on businesses allowing them to contaminate the air and water we need to live.  Overall, his presidency has been a step backward, he perpetuated hatred with his sexism, racism, and homophobia.  He has divided the country substantially and has not done anything to fix it.  He has not condemned white supremacy to the point where if you talk about it on social media trump supporters will start defending trump even if you don't say his name.  He has not spoken out against the violence that his supporters cause.  Commenting recently that he loves texas when he saw a video of trump supporters trying to run a Biden bus off of the road.  He has made rude comments about a multitude of different races, and ableness of people, allowing his supporters to believe that they are allowed to be hateful as well. I am disappointed by those who vote for him as they vote and stand for a man who allows white supremacy to exist, as well as someone who is racist, homophobic, sexist, a fake Christian (using it as a prop to gain sympathy and support), who has spread his views making republicans more volatile and radicalized.

Donald Trump does not care about global warming that is happening and with him not being in the Paris Act, it seems that we wouldnt have that many years left in Earth. Also, he really is stubborn so he never wants to listen to other opinions, hes so selfish and he only thinks about himself and what the white conservatives believe in, but that does not even show what perhaps most of the country believes in. I think what would make me more angry at this would be the fact that he will keep pushing the wall on the border, as someone who most of her family is immigrants, it feels like a joke.

Even with Trump as our president NOW, we have absolutely no collective view or understanding of how to continue our lives in this pandemic.

He opened business back up while we were still spiking, and did not care for the spread while calling it the ""Chinese Virus"" and was being racist towards Chinese people. Other countries have a better system of handling the Corona virus, and Trump shows that he cannot handle having to deal with a global pandemic. America has the most cases, and Trump is telling everyone to act normal and go about their regular business as usual. Trump actually contracted COVID, and told people not to fear the virus because we have amazing doctors who will push out a vaccine soon. He is saying it to calm the media and America, but we know that this is not true. He does not endorse wearing masks as strongly as Biden does, which shows how Trump has made wearing a mask political, when it should not be. So many people who support Trump also do not believe in wearing masks now, because their leader is telling them not to fear the virus, and not even wearing a mask himself. This leads to higher cases of COVID, and a wide range spread of the disease that could have been prevented.",,,,

Since he's taken office in 2016, hate crimes against immigrants and people of color has risen significantly, partially due to his insensitive comments that indirectly encouraged racism in our country. Moreover, he's done an excellent job at further dividing our country, as it now feels more polarized than ever. This vast polarization no longer consists of economics or the way a country should be run, but has and will continue to extend on humane issues as well. ",,,,

Apart from the fact that Trump has continuously failed to acknowledge issues related to widespread racism, sexism, gun violence, white supremacy, climate change and minority discrimination, he himself is mentally sick. When I see him talk, it is so hard for me to accept him as the President of America. He says anything that comes to his mind, and that reflects his manners, etiquettes, and prior educational background. It is true that education has no link with integrity, that is to say that no matter how educated you are, if your mindset is negative or disrespectful, you will always be like that. But this is the President. He has advisors that can tell him or teach him to say the right and neutral words because his words have weightage and influence on the people. His words are responsible for the sudden spark of gun violence cases in high schools and universities in the U.S. When he is irritated or angry, instead of swallowing it down, he actually shows his emotions on social media. It almost feels like he is the kid who never got the true love of their mother in childhood. Without a doubt, that has made him look very narcissistic. If I have to go through this all over again, I will be sad but not angry. Now I understand why America was crazy for former President Barack Obama. I saw Obama talk and walk and interact with the public. It was exceptional and he was one of a kind. When Obama spoke, it showed that he had been through growth and hardwork. It showed how polished his personality was. He didn't come in front of the camera or on twitter and just start saying garbage and especially lies. I don't know if America will ever be privileged to get a splendid president like Obama again.  But if Trump wins, I will not be surprised.",,,,

He then suggested that Americans inject bleach and disinfectant to get rid of the virus, and when some people actually did it, he said that he takes no responsibility for it. Donald Trump does not have a plan to keep Americans safe. He plans on doing more harm to them, taking their healthcare away when they need it the most, and he does not care about the lives of the people in his country.

Donald Trump will not be able to help the coronavirus pandemic and will not be able to get us back on track.

But when his fans were confronted about this they replied with ""boys will be boys"" which is a completely false argument. Whoever you are you are responsible for taking accountability of your actions. His fans will just straight up deny whatever accusations go against him. Even when they are true which in many cases has been proved through extensive investigation. His supporters need have created a cult like mindset to defy anyone who goes against him.

Roe v Wade will be overturned, and so many women's health will be compromised. Also, COVID-19 will just get worse and keep killing people because of Trump's lack of relying on science and his whole ""approach"" which is blasphemy.

His nomination, Amy Coney Barrett, has very conservative views that will harm many groups of people (LGBT, POC, and women).

Black people especially, and also immigrants, will continue to be discriminated against for the color of their skin. Racism and homophobia will also increase. 
Also, Donald Trump is very severely against any COVID safety precautions. He has not done anything to protect his citizens from this pandemic and will continue to ignore it if he gets reelected. Many more hundreds of thousands will die, and even then he will not enforce vaccines or masks, so the country will be in a public health crisis for years to come.
Trump also does not care for the environmental consequences of his actions- he does not believe in any environmental policies that will help keep the country a cleaner place for his constituents (he doesn't care because he won't be here to see the consequences).

He shows that his plans for America are mainly beneficial to him and those who follow him. This sort of exclusivity only tears apart the current American culture, which is a mixing pot of diversity.

This is awful because people will continue to die for no reason. So many of these deaths were preventible and it's terrible that so many people have lost loved ones because Trump won't assume responsibility. The way online learning is set up also puts people with less resources at an extreme disadvantage and will further deepen education inequality. Even before the pandemic Trump was an awful person which put out a newspaper ad calling for the death of the Central Park Five. The Central Park Five were teenagers when they were wrongly accused of a crime and Trump wanted them to be murdered. If he had gotten his way 5 innocent children would be dead right now. He has a history of racism and antiBlackness, as him and his father refused to have Black tenants. He called predominantly Black countries ""shithole"" countries and he has been one of the most racist presidents ever elected. Along with that he sexual assault allegations in the double digits and to be honest he's a horrible person who is not seeing heaven. He called for protestors to be shot, which is ridiculous especially considering protesting is legal. Even if it wasn't, nobody deserves to die for fighting for their rights. Racism and white supremacy existed before him and will exist after him, but it is incredibly dangerous to have him in the White House right now. The safety of people of color, the climate, women, etc is on the line.

I fear for my minority friends and family.  The fact that he chose a supreme court justice that is against gay rights and women's rights scares me as well.

When it comes to critical race theory he supports the the idea, critical race theory is openly Marxist and highly racist, books like ""White Fragility"" seem to be written by white supremacists. I can see the democrats repealing civil rights legislation in California, and other places in the west coast are implementing neo-segregation; as a mixed race person this scares me the most. As for Biden's supporters, they openly treat me with hostility for supporting Trump, I see in the media Trump supporters being shot and Biden refuses to condemn the actions, just the other day in New York, a van full of ""Jews For Trump"" had a Biden support run up and pepper spray the family inside (including kids), I see in the media democrat's calling for ""Truth And Reconciliation"" councils which seek to expose Trump supporters. If Joe Biden is elected I see these people being emboldened and going more extreme. I also find Joe Biden being open to the idea of court packing extremely alarming, even Ruth Bader Ginsburg opposed court packing. I can also see big tech censorship growing more extreme under Biden because the DNC refuses to acknowledge the existence of censorship online. The last thing that scares me about a Joe Biden presidency is we do not know what he will do and the media refuses to push him on that, the fact that Biden can say ""the voters don't deserve to know my position on ____ until after the election"" should send alarm bells to everyone.

With Donald Trump as president, there is no condemning this behavior. Donald Trump claims he is the least racist person but he doesn't go against his white supremacist supporters. In addition, he refers to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"" and this racism has caused trouble for many Chinese Americans. This activity needs to be put down by our leader. Chinese Americans are facing the repercussions of Trump's misplaced blame. On the other hand, Americans have mistreated black people throughout history. Having a black president from 2008-2016 seemed like a big step forward but Trump has brought the ugliness back into America and pushed us back into racist times. Of course people were racist before Trump, but his actions have enabled them to be comfortable with expressing their feelings. Taking Trump out of office will hopefully put America back on track. People who are racial minorities should be worried for their safety and how they will be treated in a country where our president is a racist.",,,,

Socially in the United States, Donald Trump divides people, he facilitates hatred and does not support equality of everyone. He wants to strip away the rights of minorities such as the LGBTQ+ community and others. As far as foreign affairs, our allies are less likely to side with us on issues and give us aid when needed. Trump not only divides the citizens of his own country but also divides the world. We as a nation must strive to have peace with our fellow humans around the globe, but Trump constantly shouts phrases that humiliate those of other races such as people from China and Mexico, which further marginalizes us as people. His bigotry and close-mindedness affect this pandemic as well, he undermines the epidemiologists' recommendations for safety and underplays the entire covid situation, which in turn affects the health and safety of millions of people.

At the beginning of his election, he had placed a muslim ban on the country. He also banned immigrants from coming in the country, which makes absolutely no sense because this country was also founded on immigrants who were escaping religious persecution. Although terrorism is the reason for the immigrants seeking refuge, it's still for a better life. When black Americans were unjustly being killed in this nation, Donald Trump had no kind of response to George Floyd's killing or the other innocent African Americans. Trump supports the formation of Israel too. A region that was all palestine, has now become a country who have killed and kicked out the native habitants. Lastly, a leader is someone who should represent the country in its best human form. Donald Trump is responsible for many different counts of harassment. He also lacks proper diction to be a fitting president, often using curse words and improper adjectives to describe faiths, ethnicities, and races PUBLICLY.",,,,

The hatred Donald Trump encourages among his supporters towards those who are not WASPs is one that is a complete mockery of what this country stands for and what it was built on; this country was built by those who were prosecuted and our Statute of Liberty's plaque reads ""Give me your tired, poor, and weak"" which reflect of the greatness that this country should hold with diversity.

Yet, if Trump wins, he will take off all of us in our 20s off our parent's insurance. He is lowering the age to 18! THAT IS TOO LITTLE. How does trump expect us to pay for our own health insurance at 19 years of age if we go to college, or technical school, or are working? Even if we work straight out of high school, we are not going to be getting a full-time postgraduate level salary anyways as our parents do, so how are we gonna afford it????",,,,

I’m afraid for native rights, latinx rights, lgbtq rights, black rights, Asian rights, and anything else you can think of.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for their anti-Semitism — including the charge that Israel’s supporters in Congress are disloyal to the United States. But then Trump declared that “any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat” show “great disloyalty” — using the very same anti-Semitic trope that got Omar and Tlaib in trouble in the first place.
7. He lost a needless government shutdown fight. In 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.6 billion for 65 miles of border fencing by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Instead of taking the deal, Trump shut down the government and demanded $5.7 billion. He ended up with less — $1.38 billion — than he would have if he had just gone along with the bipartisan deal.
6. He used his emergency authority to circumvent Congress on the border wall. After losing the shutdown fight, Trump used the National Emergencies Act to appropriate funds for a policy priority after Congress specifically refused to do so legislatively. Not only was this an abuse of power; it also was completely unnecessary. He could have reprogrammed money from other Treasury and Defense Department accounts without invoking his emergency powers. Instead, he chose a direct assault on Congress’s constitutional powers, and Republicans shamefully went along

He said the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan and congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of the Communist takeover. The U.S.S.R. did not invade Afghanistan “because terrorists were going into Russia” and they were not “right to be there,” as Trump claimed. They went in to prevent the replacement of a Soviet puppet regime with a regime friendly to the United States. As for China, 65 million of the roughly 100 million people killed by Communist regimes during the 20th century were killed by China. It is the most murderous regime in human history.

I think the democratic party is too concerned with social issues to the point of not looking at the big picture of what's best for the United States. He's also very fragile and I think there's a good chance of him passing away while in office which is never a good thing because usually the vice president is all of a sudden thrown into the position of president which can be very risky and rough. He appeals to liberals through his plans for economy, racism and overall human rights. Which is not even half of a presidents job.

They bomb schools and viciously kill people while reinforcing their agendas. Yet, I feel like if I moved back home my life would be less stressful. I was a fourth grader when a girl's school a block away from mine was blown to bits, killing everyone inside. I was advised not to leave my house to go to school and my parents were worried about our lives. Yet, Americans think that their freedom is restricted by wearing masks and allowing hardworking immigrants like my father, or a number of other nationalities and ethnicities, to enter the country as they will ""taint"" it. The sheer carelessness and selfishness of the American people should scare everyone. Donald Trump cares about no one except old, rich white males who control the biggest corporations on this planet. He will bulldoze over every person who is a threat to his white supremacy views in order to brainwash low income and conservation citizens who believe he will provide them a better future. I believe the election of Trump will prompt a Civil War in our near future and if the people of the United States want increased crime rates, increased racism, increased xenophobia, which by the way will tank our economy, they should go ahead and vote for Trump. We as a society love dystopian stories, so why can we not recognize the one we are in now? We are going through a combination of the Hunger Games and The HandMaid's Tale right now. People are rioting and protesting and being violently attacked by the militia, while we have a Supreme Court ready to take away our reproductive rights. What happened to separation of state and church? I will bet my life that I know the Constitution better than Trump. Nowadays, when I leave the house to work at a job that does not even pay enough for my college tuition I am afraid of the following; getting COVID-19 and infecting my family, getting killed by a cop, getting threatened or hurt by a xenophobic and racist American (which has happened multiple times) or losing my job and having to drop out of college.

Doing so would stop the growth of the economy as well as restrict people's personal freedoms. If the a large part of the nation is shut down, there could be large unemployment, which leads to trillions more spent, which leads to higher taxation. Unemployment can also affect people psychologically, and more in a bad way than good.

With Black people being killed relentlessly by police officers who are supposed to protect the peace, it has become clear that he has taken the side of white supremacy. With COVID-19, he has allowed people to believe that wearing a mask is an individual right instead of a mandatory regulation to keep everyone safe, causing thousands of deaths in America. When he himself caught COVID and received the best treatment that the country can offer, he told Americans to not be afraid. However, many Americans do not have access to healthcare and cannot afford to catch this deadly disease.

Specifically because of the precedent it sets but also because all of those people will think that that is ok and tolerated and there will never be consequences to that because Trump and his supporters will think that they won and their agenda will be validated.

If trump was to win this election I think that his supporters will increase their hatred and mistreatment of minorities, especially in the weeks following the election. I have been absolutely horrified at this response to the pandemic and watching him mock his own associates for wearing masks continues to add to the problem of those that refuse to wear masks. The spread of false information after his treatment of COVID is terrifying as the average individual is not treated for free by private teams of doctors in private hospitals with the best care possible.",,,,

I also feel like he'll be super slow to solving problems and if he does solve problems, it might be too little too late. He also seems to be really incompetent, which is certainly not needed for the president of the country.",,,,
